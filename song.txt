Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? 'Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and at once
I'm passin' on and out
(And out, and out, yeah)
It wasn't somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
